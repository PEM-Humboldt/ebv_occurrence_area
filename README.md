# ebv_occurrence_area

Block 2 of project "BON-in-a Box 2.0: Working towards an integrated biodiversity information system" seeks to enable access to integrated biodiversity data to estimate indicators required to empower rapid trend detection. This repository will contain all the code files necessary to calculate new Essential Biodiversity Variable - Occurrence Area (EBV-OA) using occupancy models, based on eBird data for birds and camera trapping data for mammals in Colombia. Currently we will start uploading scripts form other sources to start adapting them for this project and therefore filling out the rest of this file.
